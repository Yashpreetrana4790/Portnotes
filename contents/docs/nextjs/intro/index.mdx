## Overview

Welcome to the Next.js guide. Here, you'll find all the information you need to get started with Next.js, a powerful React framework for building server-side rendered and static websites.

Next.js provides a great developer experience and includes built-in support for server-side rendering (SSR), static site generation (SSG), and API routes. Whether you're building a full-fledged web application or a simple static site, Next.js has you covered.

## Prerequisites

Before proceeding, ensure you have the following:

- **Node.js installed**: It's recommended to use Node.js version 16.x or later. You can download it from [Node.js official website](https://nodejs.org/).
- **Basic knowledge of React**: Familiarity with React will help you understand and leverage Next.js effectively.
- **A code editor**: A good code editor like [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) will enhance your development experience.

## Installation Steps

1. **Create a New Next.js Project**:
   Use the following command to create a new Next.js application. This command will set up a new project with all the necessary dependencies and configuration:

   ```bash
   npx create-next-app@latest my-next-app
