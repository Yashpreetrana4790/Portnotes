## Next.js Overview

- **Next.js** is a popular open-source framework built on top of React, designed to enable features like server-side rendering (SSR) and static site generation (SSG), which improve performance and SEO for web applications. It combines the benefits of React's component-based architecture with optimized rendering techniques.

### Key Features :

### Server-Side Rendering (SSR):

- Next.js can render pages on the server before sending them to the client, which improves performance and SEO by delivering a fully rendered HTML page. This is particularly useful for dynamic content.

### Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR):

- This allows you to update static content after the site has been built, without having to rebuild the entire site. It provides the benefits of SSG with the flexibility to update content as needed.

### Static Site Generation (SSG):

- It allows the pre-rendering of pages at build time, generating static HTML files that can be served directly by a CDN. This is ideal for content that doesn't change often, like blogs or marketing pages.

### Hybrid Rendering:

- Next.js supports combining SSR and SSG within the same application. You can choose on a per-page basis whether a page should be server-rendered or statically generated.

### Folder based Routing:

- The file system is used as the routing system in Next.js. Any file added to the `app` directory automatically becomes a route.

### API Routes:

- Next.js allows the creation of API endpoints within the application using the `/api` directory. This feature is handy for building back-end services within your Next.js app.

### Code Splitting:

- Next.js automatically splits your code into smaller bundles that are loaded only when needed, improving page load times and overall performance.

### Built-in CSS and Sass Support:

- It provides built-in support for CSS and Sass, allowing you to import styles directly into your components.

### Image Optimization:

- The `next/image` component allows for optimized image loading with features like automatic resizing, lazy loading, and serving images in modern formats.

### Built-in TypeScript Support:

- Next.js has first-class support for TypeScript, making it easier to develop and maintain a type-safe codebase.
