Next.js is needed because it addresses several challenges and limitations associated with traditional React applications, especially in areas like performance, SEO, and developer experience. 


## Advantages of Next.js

- SEO-Friendly: SSR and SSG provide better SEO compared to traditional client-side rendering (CSR).
- Performance: Optimized rendering and automatic code-splitting lead to faster load times.
- Developer Experience: Simplifies routing, API creation, and state management with minimal configuration.
- Scalability: Suitable for small personal projects as well as large-scale enterprise applications.
